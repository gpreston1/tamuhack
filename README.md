squid game inspired financial literacy game made in Unity.

The Assets Folder contains most of our work, including c# scripts, sprites, backgrounds, etc.

The rest of the files are from Unity which are needed to run the game, but not all of them could be uploaded because of the amount.
However, we can run the demo on our laptops.
